# Reusable backend for your CRUD apps
The default template to kickstart your projects 
- Originally for specific-purpose projects so some changes might be necessary
- Follows a good convention for backend. Simple, organized, understandble and structured.

## Password-based Authentication
Clone the ```password-login``` branch as follows to get started

```git clone -b password-login https://github.com/5ujan/ReusabaleBackend.git```

This is a bare-bones approach to achieve authentication for your CRUD apps.
### JWT
- Uses password and email for authentication, after each creates a jwt to save sessions.
- password is saved in the DB after one-way sha-256 hashing
- jwt is sent back if password matches during successive logins or if signing up

### Verification
Additional verification can be done to prevent fraudulent activites  
**SMS or Email verification:**  
 use a smtp service to send a pin generated by backend to verify email(or phone, if you decide to use phone numbers instead) during signup. Only creating users if confirmed pin code matches the one created by backend.
_this isn't currently implemented as all smtp services require a subsciption, I tried using google and hotmail but account got suspended after half a dozen emails_

## Google OAuth 2.0
Clone the [main](https://github.com/5ujan/ReusableBackend) branch if you want to implement google oauth2.0 and get started.
- Passport & JWT
- Image upload features
